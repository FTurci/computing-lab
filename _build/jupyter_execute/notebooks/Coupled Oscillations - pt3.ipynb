    "Before we consider the complete solution for systems of coupled oscillators it is worth reminding ourselves of the solution for the simple harmonic oscillator problem. We remind ourselves that the simple harmonic oscillator equation is,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "m \\ddot x = -k x\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $m$ and $k$ are the mass and the spring constant respectively. We also note these are both $m$ and $k$ are real and positive. We also deduce that the frequency is $\\omega= \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.There are many and equivalent ways in which you might write the (trial) solution. \n",

    "we can see (1) and (2) are equivalent if $\\delta' = \\delta +\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n",

    "To obtain the full solution of our problem we need to determine the constants $x_o$ and $\\delta$ from (1) and (3) or $x_o$ and $\\delta'$ from (2) and (4). We can see that this is possible if we know the value of $x$ and $\\dot x$ at a particular point in time. For example, if $x(0)=C$ and $\\dot x(0) =0$ then from (1) and (3) $x_o= C$ and $\\delta = 0 $ or from (2) and (4) we get $x_o=C$ and $\\delta' = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The keypoint  is that we need to find two constants, the amplitude and phase (even if one of them, $\\delta$ is zero).\n",
