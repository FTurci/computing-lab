If you wish to look a list of attributes and methods for numpy uncomment the dir(np) line. However, for details you may find it easier to look it up on line at https://numpy.org/ where you will find extensive resources and explanations. We will use a small set of the numpy functions here. Note how we have used the import statement to shorten the name by which we will refer to the numpy library i.e. 'np'"

You can also see how it is possible to populate the list with numbers of different types. The last example (list g) shows how lists with numbers at different intervals may be created. Why did we need to use 22 as the end point in the range statement if we want the final element in the list to be 21?\n",

    "'zeros' is similar to arange, except it pre-populates the list with the number of elements required but all set to zero. The default is float but as you can see you can also define complex zeros or integer zeros. To check you have understood these functions try adding a new list of 10 integer zeros to the code above.\n",

    "In the previous notebook we looked at some simple code to do numerical integration using the column method. We mentioned that in general it is easier and better to use the numerical integration routines that are already available in python. To use some of these routines we need to make use of lists that we can create using the methods described above. The routine we are going to use is found in the scipy library. As we showed in the previous notebook you can get help on the scipy routines within python but as before it is probably easiet to look on the https://www.SciPy.org web site for details. There, you may find plenty of examples and tutorials. This web site also has web links to information about NumPy, Matplotlib as well SymPy - a very useful library for doing symbolic algebra calculations that we, unfortunately, do not have time to cover in this course.\n",
