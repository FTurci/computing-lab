    "# 1. An Introduction to Python and Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first Jupyter notebook associated with the PHYS10008 unit. The purpose of this notebook is to introduce you to Jupyter notebooks and how they work. When you have completed this notebook you should be familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the basic concept of a Jupyter notebook,\n",
    "- the way in which text and code fragments are written in cells in the notebook, \n",
    "- how to enter simple text into 'text cells',\n",
    "- how to enter python code into 'code cells',\n",
    "- how to run, clear and restart Jupyter notebooks,\n",
    "- how to recognise coding errors and simple strategies to resolve them,\n",
    "- how to introduce python packages into your code,\n",
    "- how to execute simple 'calculator like' snippets of python code in a notebook,\n",
    "- how to use the math package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Structure of a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are reading this, then you have already managed to start a Jupyter notebook. The first thing to note is a Jupyter notebook is divided into cells. There are two main types of cell that we will be concerned with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Markdown' cells that contain text and notes (this cell is an example of a Markdown cell),\n",
    "- 'Code' cells that, in this unit, contain the python computer code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how they are used in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 The Menu bar\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the notebook you will find two menu bars which you use to edit and control the function of the notebook. The top menu bar consists of several tabs that contain all the commands that can be used to modify the notebook. The second line, consisting of clickable icons provides shortcuts to some of the common notebook commands, including saving the notebook ('floppy disk symbol'), adding cells ('+') and cut, copy and paste functions. The other icos allow cells to be moved within the notebook and control the execution of the code in the cells or the whole notebook. If you hover, with the mouse, over each icon its function will be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Creating Markdown and Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "New cells may be added to the notebook using the '+' button on the menu bar. This will by default create a code cell immediately below the current cell. A code cell may be recognised as it has the form \n",
    "\n",
    "In [n]:\n",
    "\n",
    "where n represents the current sequence or execution number of the python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "__IMPORTANT.__ This sequence number does not refer to a line number in the underlying code. If you execute the same cell again the sequence number will increment by one. The order in which the cells are executed in a notebook does not have to be sequential (top to bottom), so you could execute a cell at the end of a notebook, followed by one at the top. Hence, this number shows you the order in which _you_ have executed the cells. This can be very confusing and we will discuss in detail later.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To make a code cell into a markdown cell, go to the menu bar and find the button marked 'code' with a pull down list. You then select the 'Markdown' option and you will see the code prompt disappear. You can type text into this box and as you get more experienced you will learn more sophisticated ways to format it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, as you will see later, with a little knowledge of the $L_AT_EX$  text processing language you can even write equations such as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)=\\int x^2 dx$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leave describing how to do this until later.\n",
    "\n",
    "__IMPORTANT.__ Markdown cells may in in two states, _editable_ or _viewable_. In order to change the contents of a markdown cell you need to be in the editable state. Double-clicking a markdown cell in the viewable state will change it to the editable state. If the cell is in the editable state then it can be changed to the viewable state by either, clicking the 'Run' icon on the menu bar, or by, _\\< CTRL>\\< ENTER>_ on the keyboard. When the changed to, viewable, the text you have typed is processed to required, more readable form in a way similar to the _HyperTextMarkupLanguage (HTML)_ used for web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the notebook you may also find that the notebook creates, for single line commands, additional, non-editable cells that contain the single line output from the code. These may be recognised as they have the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "Out [n]:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Running the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load a Jupyter Notebook for editing it immediately starts an _instance_ of the python _kernel_ . The kernel will execute any python commands that it receives, in the order it receives them. (This is also true of standalone python consoles such as Anaconda or Idle). When the notebook is first loaded _no_ python commands have been executed and no variables will have been set. However, unnless cleared, the notebook may show the results of previous calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any cell in a notebook may be 'Run' at any time using the 'Run' button on the menu bar or on the cell itself. There is no specific order in which they need to be executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have noted (1.1.2), when run, a markdown cell changes its state from 'editable' to 'Viewable'. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a Code cell the python code in the cell is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "__IMPORTANT.__ There are some very important points you should note when running code in your notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the code cells in your worksheet may be executed in any order with the Run button,\n",
    "- if a cell has not been executed, no sequence number will be shown,\n",
    "- when a code cell is executed its sequence number, in the square brackets is shown,\n",
    "- the notebook remembers the results from previously executed cells in the order they were executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use successfully the Jupyter Notebook, you need to understand how to control the kernel. The 'Kernel' tab on the menu gives you several options  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Interrupt - this will stop any code currently executing, but nothing else is changed. You can carry on executing cells afterwards. You may use this option if your code gets stuck in a loop (we'll discuss this later),\n",
    "- Restart - A new kernel is started. All previous variables, functions, etc are cleared. The notebook can run code again but the output (Out[] cells, error messages etc.) from the previous kernel remains in the notebook until overwritten.\n",
    "- Restart & Clear Output - as above, the kernel is restarted but in this case all previous output is cleared,\n",
    "- Restart & Run All - the kernel is restarted and the code blocks in the notebook are executed in order.\n",
    " \n",
    " The last option is the best way to finally verify that your code is working so you should work on ordering your code blocks to be sequentially executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__IMPORTANT.__ You will be asked to complete assignments as Jupyter Notebooks. These will be autograded using a special format Jupyter Notebook that can be used with _nbgrader_ system that you will hear about later. It is essential for these assignments that the notebook runs properly using the 'Restart & Run All\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also quickly validate your notebook with the 'Validate' button to pick up basic mistakes (but not runtime errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Editing Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Reordering cells in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can re-arrange code and text in the notebooks cells using the cut & paste function on the menu bar. It is also very easy to re-order the cells in the notebook using the 'up' and 'down' buttons on the menu bar. These will move the current cell (code or markdown) up or down on step in the notebook respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Editing Markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen that when you open your Jupyter notebook you may find the markdown cells in either their 'editable' or 'Viewable' state. To make a viewable editable you should double-click somehere in the cell. To make an editable cell viewable you should execute the cell using the 'Run' button or \\< CTRL>\\< ENTER>. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should try editing the following markdown cell by entering you name at the point indicated. You can also see how headers and sub-headers are created using the '#', '##', '###' symbols etc. If you look at the markdown cells in this and other notebooks you will see other ways in which text may be formated, i.e. as __bold__ or _italics_ or as equation in the $L_AT_EX$ format using \\\\$ LATEX FORMAT \\\\$. We will look at some of these options later, but you will learn a lot by looking at the markdown cells when they are in their editable state. \n",

    "You should see that the code does not seem to have done what we wanted. This will certainly not be the last time you find an error in your code and as you can see the error messages are not always as informative as you might hope! Error messages can be very frustrating and it can be easy to go round and round in circles trying to fix them. If you are not sure what is happening then copying the error message into a web search may help explain the error. This is what I found with a quick google search on \"SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal\" message:\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"In Python, the error SyntaxError: EOL while scanning literal string occurs when the python interpreter reaches the end of the line while searching for a string literal or a character within the line. The syntax error eol while scanning literal string in python is due to the missing quotation in the string, typing mistakes generally.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more helpful and maybe we can see that we didn't close the quotes for \"Hello World\". Before we do anything further note the number, _n_ in the In [n] for the code cell.  Now go back to this cell and edit the line to add the extra \" that you need after World. Hopefully you will see the error disappear when you run the cell. Note also that number In [n] has increased by one indicating that we have executed this cell again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion boards are also a good way of finding out what error messages mean. There is a Blackboard discussion board associated with this unit. If you find an error message you can't resolve you may find the answer on the discussion board already, if not, may post a query that I or maybe one of your fellow students may be able to answer to explain how to resolve your problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.4 Saving Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going any further you should save this notebook using the 'floppy disk' symbol in the menu bar or by usinf the 'File' tab. When you save the notebook all the changes you have made in the text and code cells will be saved, for example, your name will be saved where you typed it and the quotation mark you added to the code cell will saved as well. It will also save the results that you obtained when running a cell - including any error messages and the execution number for each cell. \n",

    "__Note.__ Jupyter notebooks have an extension _.ipynb_ if you need to search for or recognise them on your computer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to save a 'clean' version of your notebook you may wish to restart the kernel & clear output before you save it. Alternatively, you may wish  to restart the kernel and Run All if you wish to save all the results (perhaps if the code takes some time to run). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note. When loading a Jupyter notebook a new kernel is started, So, you might find on reloading, the notebook that you thought was working gives different results or errors if your code cells are not in the sequence you thought! \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a Jupyter Notebook is a live document, as you change it the way it works will change. You may periodically wish to save separate versions that you know work so you can 'roll-back' to a working version if you can't fix your working version. It is also a good idea to keep regular backups on a different computer. \n",
