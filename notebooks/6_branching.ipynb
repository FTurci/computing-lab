    "In the note books you have used so far you have only seen code that runs smoothly from start to finish. For these you can see, or work out, the exact sequence of instructions that will be carried out once the programme has started to run. However, it is exceedingly common in our numerical methods to control the execution of a programme according to calculations made earlier. In this notebook you will learn how to use to use conditional statements to control the flow of your programme.\n",
